Hello!

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

I am Shaeekh Al Jahan, I have completed B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="http://aust.edu/">Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST)</a>, Dhaka, Bangladesh. I was actively engaged in programming contest in my varsity days, and in research work based on Ml, DL in the last year.
For a sustainable world, small steps do matter. I believe in computer based solutions ( collaborating with other sectors)  for building and leading community in order to fulfill our purposes together.   <br /><br /></div>
 
<b> I am open to any Research Collaborations in the field of *NLP*, *Bioinformatics* and *Human Centered Computing*. Please reach out if you have anything to discuss or want to work together.  </b> <a href="shaeekhshuvro@gmail.com"><i class="fas fa-envelope"></i></a> <br />
